Description:
A simple chatbot created as part of self-study. The bot ignores everything other than words, digits, and spaces. It bases on arrays of arrays that include utterances and the answers. The page presents a dialog field where you can see the messages of the bot and the user. Answers appear with a two-second delay to give the impression that the bot is thinking what answer to give. The bot only understands English.
